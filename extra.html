Lesson 0

<p>Adrian Holovaty&#8217;s seminal essay, <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/writing/fundamental-change/">&#8220;A fundamental way newspaper sites need to change,&#8221;</a> still describes many of the challenges newsrooms face. Newsrooms still need people who can embrace data and learn how to structure the endless amount of information journalists take in every day. In fact, Holovaty may provide the most succinct definition of what journalism means in the digital age: &#8220;important, focused information that is useful to people&#8217;s lives and helps them understand the world.</p>

<p>Both <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/c3e6c0661397">Tasneem Raja</a> and <a href="http://www.ryanpitts.com/writing/why-i-love-what-i-do/">Ryan Pitts</a> write more personal essays on how and why they code in a newsroom. Where Raja found greater efficiency and the ability to salvage and store important information more effectively, Pitts found the ways that coding in a newsroom can foster individual connections. The ways that coding for journalism can make your work more meaningful are endless. These are just some stories that we hope can inspire you.</p>

<p><a href="http://alistapart.com/article/dao">&#8220;A Dao of Web Design,&#8221;</a> by John Allsopp, was written in 2000 during a very different time for the Internet. Yet its fundamental lesson is the same. The web is its own medium, and we should treat it as such. &#8220;Dao&#8221; is a rather erudite essay, but try to tease out the central meanings as it applies to how you might design projects in the future. Even in 2000, Allsopp summarized the philosophy of responsive web design: &#8220;Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that we have established why coding for journalism is an important and some central philosophy behind it, we can talk about what applying code to journalism actually looks like. Our own Rich Gordon <a href="http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/06/28/want-to-build-a-data-journalism-team-youll-need-these-three-people/">summarizes the skills</a> needed for a data journalism team into three groups: computer-assisted reporting, news apps development and data visualization. Our future lessons will touch on the skills needed for all three jobs. You do not have to decide now, but think about which positions appeal to you the most.</p>

<p>Finally, learning to code is scary, and Noah Veltman&#8217;s <a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/56132893301/code-the-newsroom-and-self-doubt">&#8220;Code, the newsroom, and self-doubt&#8221;</a> articulates feelings we all have as we struggle learning the many skills we need. Know that you are not alone, and everyone fails many times before they succeed. </p>

Lesson 1

<p>With the proper mindset established, it is time to begin talking about what the Internet actually is and how it works. The <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/">Don&#8217;t Fear the Internet</a> videos serve as a fun, simple introduction to the topic and provide some nice metaphors for the basic architecture of the web. Try to replicate the things they do in the video yourself to get some rudimentary practice.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Google published an ebook of sorts called <a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US"><em>20 Things I Learned about Browsers and the Web.</em></a> Some of the info, especially that regarding plugins and extensions, is outdated, but the chapters assigned here go over fundamental technology that has existed for decades.</p>

<p>Finally, it is time to start coding. Use <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Shay Howe&#8217;s helpful lessons</a> to read through and replicate some of the HTML he presents in the first two lessons. How do you replicate his code? Simple: download a <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">text editor</a> and create a new file with the file extension <code>.html</code>. Then, start typing your first HTML in there. See if you can get some code to work. You can test it out by opening your new HTML file in a web browser.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy Web Fundamentals</a> course provides all of the tools you need in the browser and will take you through all of the basics of HTML you need to know before we move on to CSS and styling in the next lesson.</p>

Lesson 2

<p>While understanding how the Internet works is a fundamental lesson that must be learned before making the web can begin, understanding design is a skill that no one ever stops learning. Design must be practiced to master. This lesson introduces some core concepts of design, but we will certainly be revisiting this topic time and time again.</p>

<p>Before we get to the actual languages and tools we use to design on the web, read through <a href="http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/design/DesignClass1Pres.pdf">Lena Groeger&#8217;s introductory slides</a>. The core concepts she introduces: proximity, alignment, contrast and repetition, may seem obvious, but when used correctly, they can be incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>The next installment of <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com">Don&#8217;t Fear the Internet</a> videos will introduce some of the tools we&#8217;ll be using for our work as well as show off some of the power of CSS, the language we will be using for styling HTML. Note, however, that the video is a little outdated, and their recommendation of Textmate as a good text editor is not such a good one anymore. We recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>.</p>

<p>For a glance at where we are headed, read Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s revolutionary article introducing <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive web design</a>, which has taken the web design world by storm over the past few years. As you hone your design skills, start thinking about all the different devices that might use what you make and how you can design for them. </p>

<p>The next three links go through various tutorials that introduce CSS. As before, the <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">Shay Howe tutorial</a> is best when you try to recreate some of the examples he shows. Play around with them and see what you can get to change. The <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy tutorial</a> provides a more interactive way of introducing syntax. </p>

<p>Finally, we are introducing <a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly">Dash</a>, another interactive tutorial platform that will hopefully expand your range. The last task of project 1 is to build your own portfolio site. This will force you to think more about what you have learned and build something. When you fill out the Google form for this lesson, submit the URL Dash provides for your final project if you would like feedback!</p>

Lesson 3

<p>For Lesson 3, we are going to briefly step away from the browser, HTML and CSS to talk about the command line and version control. This may seem disconnected, but learning to use the command line and version control is an essential practice in a modern development environment.</p>

<p>The command line is hard. It is a completely new way (actually, the <em>old</em> way) of interacting with your computer. Instead of pointing and clicking, you type everything. But as you master the command line, you will find it more productive and perhaps more enjoyable than the point-and-click model you are used to.</p>

<p>The command line has many uses, and we will return to it later in the lessons when we talk about data processing, but for now, we are going to establish the basics so that you can use git, a version control system.</p>

<p>Git and version control are probably completely foreign concepts, but think of them as very powerful versions of track changes in Microsoft Word. They are a way of tracking every change you make to any file in a project. </p>

<p>Look at Dan Sinker&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy">Tacofancy</a> repository for a simple and delicious example of a living, breathing git repository. Notice how it looks like you are browsing any set of folders on your computer; that&#8217;s because it is really the same thing. More importantly, click on &#8220;commits&#8221; under the repository description. Notice the many different people that have committed to the project. GitHub makes working on git repositories collaborative so that many people can easily work on the same project.</p>

<p>Click on one of the buttons with a seemingly random assortment of numbers and letters on the right. Here, you are seeing a &#8220;diff,&#8221; which shows the changes in each file within that &#8220;commit.&#8221; Minuses mean those lines were removed, while pluses mean those lines were added. Commits offer a history of every change in your repository.</p>

<p>At this point, it may be helpful to separate <em>git</em> from <em>GitHub</em>. Git is the version control system used to track changes. GitHub is simply a web service that allows you to remotely store git repositories.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s get you going on the command line. Go through Zed Shaw&#8217;s <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Command Line Crash Course</a> through &#8220;removing a file.&#8221; This may take you some time, and it will probably be the most difficult thing you have done thus far. The only way to truly learn the command line is through repetition, so do what the book instructs. You will get better with time.</p>

<p>After you feel comfortable with navigating your filesystem with the command line, move onto <a href="http://try.github.io">Try Git</a>. This emulates a command line in your browser to allow you to try some git commands. Make sure you pay attention to the area below the prompt, as it will show you an emulated project directory where the git repository lives.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s get Git (get it?) setup on your own computer. First, you should make a <a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a> account. Next, go to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">Set Up Git</a> and follow the instructions for your particular operating system. Do <em>not</em> install the GUI application (i.e. GitHub for Mac or GitHub for Windows). Those are nice tools, but learning the command line will be essential for you as a future developer.</p>

<p>Next, read <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics">Chapter 2 of Git Pro</a>. This will go more in-depth with some of the commands you learned from Try Git. This chapter can always be a reference for you if you forget how some commands work.</p>

<p>We will be using the command line and Git extensively throughout the rest of our lessons, and they will prove invaluable for you in your own projects. When you feel comfortable with the command line and Git, move onto our first project-based lesson to combine everything you have learned so far!</p>

Lesson 4

<p>The time has finally come. In lesson 4, you are going to build your own personal website.</p>

<p>You have the skills: You know how the internet works, you know the basics of HTML and CSS, and you know how to put something up on GitHub. That is all you need to know to put up your first personal website.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://deniselu.com">Denise Lu&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://juliekliegman.com">Julie Kliegman&#8217;s</a> personal websites as examples of simple but effective portfolio sites that use (mostly) HTML and CSS, and nothing much more complicated than what you already know. Inspect element, view source, and look at their GitHub repos (Denise&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/denisedslu/denisedslu.github.io">here</a> and Julie&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/jmkliegman/jmkliegman.github.io">here</a>) to see how they did it.</p>

<p>Next, read <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">GitHub&#8217;s tutorial</a> on how to create a repo. Then, create a repo for yourself that will host your personal website. <strong>Importantly, name the repo yourusername.github.io.</strong> This will allow you to host your personal website on GitHub for free (at yourusername.github.io).</p>

<p>Once your repo is created on both GitHub and your local machine, start making! If you want to do something and don&#8217;t know how to do it, start Googling and figure it out! Much of making on the web is figuring out how to do things yourself. With your knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax, you should be able to figure out most any new thing you see within those two languages.</p>

<p>Within the feedback form on this lesson, submit your repo for feedback!</p>

Lesson 5

<p>I have good news and bad news.</p>

<p>The good news: You built a website! That&#8217;s awesome! It&#8217;s also hosted on the Internet for free, which is always a very good thing.</p>

<p>The bad news: HTML and CSS aren&#8217;t technically programming. So we haven&#8217;t gotten to that yet. But the time is now! This lesson serves as an introduction to JavaScript, the programming language used to talk to the web browser. </p>

<p>Pay attention to the order of the materials here; it&#8217;s intentional. Do the first lesson of <a href="http://try.jquery.com" target="_blank">Try jQuery</a>, paying special attention to the intro video. It might be the best explanation of the DOM and why JavaScript and jQuery are useful. But actually learning jQuery before you know some basic JavaScript might be confusing.</p>

<p>After lesson one, spend some time with the <a href="http://www.jsforcats.com" target="_blank">JS for Cats</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> tutorials. They will teach you about variables and functions, which are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript code. </p>

<p>Following those lessons, return to <a href="http://try.jquery.com">Try jQuery</a> and finish it out. It might take some time, but you should leave this lesson with a good understanding of what JavaScript is and does. You should also have a fundamental understanding of programming. </p>
